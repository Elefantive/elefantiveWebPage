✨Welcome to Elefant'ive ✨! 

French and living in Germany, I find my inspiration in this constant multicultural environment. With two little treasures at home, I’m always motivated to create original activities and games for them.

Discover creative sewing products 🧵✂️  and artsy inspiration 🎨🎭for the whole family. From practical everyday items to beautiful, unique pieces, there's something for babies, kids, men, and women 🎁.

✍️Feel free to contact me (DM) if you're interested, I’d love to craft something just for you, tailored to your taste!
